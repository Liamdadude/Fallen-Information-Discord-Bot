Saddy Case File

Gender: female 
spesies/race: furson (poodle moth)
Personality: she is the punch now ask questions later tipe. Despite her appearance  she is not cuddly and will kill you if you hug her so don't. All she wants is to be taken seriously and respected. If you make her mad she will blow up and make a scene. She is not important to the story at all.
Other stuff: she can fly if you were wondering. She works  as a hetherston palace  gard/police person thingy. Her favorite color is pastel purple. She only has three fingers on each hand  because she is literally a bug.she has a lot of fluff under that sweater.
